//HOW CAN I HELP? You donâ€™t have to cut out meat entirely to make a difference.
// By making small sacrifices and making conscious purchasing decisions, we can all contribute to a better world. 

//Opt for products from animals that haven't been tortured. When purchasing meat, egg, or dairy products, 
//look for obvious animal welfare labeling on the packaging.

//Eliminate one animal product from one meal each day (e.g. drop the sausage at breakfast, grilled chicken from your salad, 
//or bacon from your club sandwich).
